# Kaggle-Human-Protein-Atlas-Image-Classification

## Motivation: 
Nowadays, with the rapid development of bioscience and technology, images visualizing proteins in a wide range of different human cells have been generated and recognized at a far greater pace than what can be manually evaluated. Therefore, the demand for developing a more advanced image classification technique is greater than ever for automatically analyzing those biomedical patterns and images to promote the research of human cells and organs.
## Results: 
In this project, we have trained several convolutional neural networks based on pretrained Resnet34, Resnet50 and Inception-ResNet V2 model, finally, we choose the network based on pretrained Resnet 34 with 512*512*4 inputs and obtained 0.48 test score on the kaggle leaderboard (Top 8% on Dec 1).
